# sling-nosql-frontend

Supporting code for my Snowcamp 2016 talk, http://sched.co/5nB9

This is a demo using Apache Sling as a front-end for NoSQL databases running in Docker, with dynamic DB discovery.

I need to complete these instructions to allow you to run this demo and find your way around it - feel free to bug me if I don't.

For now, you need to build the Sling modules with `mvn clean install` in the `slingbuild` folder, and also build the `Dockerfile` found there as explained in its comments.

Then, follow the [cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md) to run the demo.
